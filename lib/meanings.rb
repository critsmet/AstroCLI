    },
  Taurus: {
    Sun: "Taurus natives are sensual folk–and this includes sex, but extends to pleasures in all areas: they delight in the sensual pleasures of food, a comfortable blanket, a richly colored aquarium to look at, the smell of flowers or spring rain, pleasing melodies coming from their stereos, and so forth. Though they are dependable most of the time, this generally shows itself more in habit than in outright helpfulness.",
    Moon: "Familiarity is important to Lunar Taureans. These people are earthy and strong-willed. They feel with their senses and they are pretty much rooted in their ways.",

Watch for over-indulgence.",

  },
  Gemini: {
    Sun: "With the Sun in Gemini, the urge for self-expression is strong. These natives are often just as interested in collecting information as they are in sharing it. Curious to a fault, Geminis have a finger in every pie. ",
    Moon: "Lunar Geminis are usually pleasant, witty, and charming people. At home and with family, however, they can be moody and irritable at times.",
    Mercury: "Mercury in Gemini people are generally quick-witted. They can come across as somewhat scattered, and this is mainly due to their eclectic interests. They seem to know a little about everything.",
    Venus: "Venus in Gemini people will try to win over the object of their affection with witty conversation, displaying just how much they “know”, and demonstrating their diverse interests. These lovers are playful — some might even call them a tease.",

  },

    Moon: "Moon in Cancer people are never detached — they cling to things, their home, and people they care for. They seek out security and familiarity in all they do. They look for peace and quiet.",
    Mercury: "These people communicate with feeling, conveying a sensitive, withdrawn, and thoughtful nature to the people they interact with. If this is the only personal planet in Cancer in their chart, they may come across as more personal and sensitive than they actually are.",
    Venus: "Love for Venus in Cancer is best when it is committed and rather predictable. These people are sensitive in love, even if their Sun sign is the more playful and outgoing signs of Gemini or Leo.",
    Mars: "This position inclines toward passive-aggressiveness. These people seem to resist change and to shy away from direct confrontations. They need to feel secure before they act.",

    Saturn: "Saturn in Cancer is not very emotionally demonstrative. They prefer to hide their inner thoughts and feelings. Home and family is of utmost importance.

  Leo: {
    Uranus: "Incred energy and boldness makes anyone with this placement extremely confident with a power-hungry streak.",

    Jupiter: "This placement understands that generosity brings success. There is a magnanimity and generosity that inspires others to act with dignity and sincerity.",
    Saturn: "Leo Saturn can undermine their goals by undervaluing themselves. This attitude of inferiority can sabotage all they work towards. Their feelings of jealousy and lack of spontaneity can push others away. They often put up a coldness towards others to protect themselves emotionally. Their challenge is to connect with others and find value within themselves.",
    Sun: "There’s an unmistakably regal air to Solar Leos. These are dignified–even noble–folk. Leos have a reputation for being conceited, but think again. Leos do feel important, but this generally takes the form of wanting to change the world in some way–to make the world a better place. They are generally motivated by affection for people.",

Routine and order are important components in their lives. They may get so caught up in the details, however that they lose sight of the big picture.",
    Sun: "Virgo people are generally respectable, hard-working individuals who have a love of knowledge and know-how.Virgo’s symbol, the Virgin, shows itself in the lives of Virgos through a love of all that is “natural” and a certain purity of spirit that keeps Virgos self-sufficient and self-contained, at least on the surface.",

    Saturn: "Saturn in Libra must learn how to relate to other people on a personal and social level. They need to take responsibility for their actions in relationships. It lies entirely in their hands whether a relationship will be the source of growth or suffering. If they are receptive, reliable, tactful and organized, they could gain status and wealth.",

They can be so intense that it can be overwhelming to those who are not as directed as they are. Full of willpower and energy, they are so determined to meet their goals it is hard for them to remain calm.",
    Moon: "While others may find security and comfort in material things, Moon in Scorpio people seek out emotional intensity. No matter what, there is something very intense about Lunar Scorpios.

By working hard and through determination, they often find themselves at the pinnacle of industrial, commercial or political success. They often gain in wealth as a side effect, though Capricorn Jupiter may find something tragic in being wealthy.",
    Saturn: "Saturn in Capricorn is very cautious and detail-oriented. They can be very charming or persistent when they want something. They are gifted with persuasion, and may make an effective speaker. They are fair and impartial. They have great foresight, and are gifted with practical matters.

They may resent being told what they don't want to hear.",
